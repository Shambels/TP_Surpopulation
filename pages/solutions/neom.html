    <p><b>First robots got citizenship, then plan to have children and now they can receive their own city? Saudi
        Arabia’s crown prince plans to build a city bigger than Dubai and with more robots than humans.</b></p>

    <p>Here’s everything you need to know about sci-fi city Neom in the Desert.</p>

    <h2 class="bleu">Utopian Megacity</h2>
    <p>The $500 billion megacity, whose name is an amalgamation of neo—Latin for “new”—and “m” for the first letter in
      mustaqbal, the Arabic word for “future,” is promised to be filled with skyscrapers, five-star hotels, and robots
      to free humans from repetitive labor. Robots may outnumber humans as “a new blueprint for sustainable life”, which
      would be entirely powered by renewable energy, and served by driverless vehicles and vertical farms.</p>
    <p><i>“Repetitive and arduous tasks will be fully automated and handled by robots, which may exceed the population,
        likely making the Neom’s GDP per capita the highest in the world,” is written on the project’s website. “All
        these elements will put Neom at the world’s forefront in terms of efficiency, which will make it the best
        destination in the world to live in.”</i></p>

    <h2 class="bleu">Saudi’s city of future</h2>
    <div class="flex tablet-wrap">
      <div>

        <p>Saudi Arabia’s crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has a strong desire to create a very first sci-fi city of
          future
          with numerous robots, advanced manufacturing, biotech that will make it a fully automated city.</p>

        <p>“We want the main robot and the first robot in Neom to be Neom, robot number one,” the crown prince said in
          an
          interview in a palatial setting next to the Ritz Carlton in Riyadh. “Everything will have a link with
          artificial
          intelligence, with the Internet of Things—everything.”</p>

        <p>It is also expected that the new city will become a future for Saudi’s economy that’s now facing a severe
          financial squeeze.</p>

        <p>The city “constitutes an attempt to create an economic zone that is more efficient and streamlined than the
          overall economy that will take time to reform,” said James Dorsey, a Middle East specialist at Singapore’s
          Nanyang
          Technological University. “The question is whether one can isolate a megacity from the inefficiencies of the
          country’s economy.”</p>

        <h2 class="bleu">Location</h2>
        <p>Neom will be partly located in an area known as Ras Sheikh al-Hameed, a peninsula of land jutting about 31
          miles (50 kilometers) into waters of the Red Sea after turning west off of route 5, the Saudi coastal road.
          The city is going to span an area of 26,500 square kilometres, stretching across the borders of northwest
          Saudi Arabia into Jordan and Egypt.</p>
        <p>The aim is to create an independent economic trade zone with its own laws that further will become the
          first private business zone to span three countries.</p>

      <h2 class="bleu">No alcohol allowed</h2>
      <p>Saudi cities are famous for strict Islam regulations that for example, forbid alcohol, women driving (the law
        is set to change next year) and gender mixing in public places. Alongside Dubai is alcohol is tolerated, as are
        tourists in bikinis, and the United Arab Emirates government has allocated land for churches and temples.</p>
      <p>According to promo video, Neom is going to be more Dubai-like. Although the futuristic city will be business
        friendly, the government won’t allow alcohol, Prince Mohammed said.</p>
      <p>“We can do 98 percent of the standards applied in similar cities, but there is 2 percent we can’t do, like, for
        example, alcohol,” the prince said. “A foreigner, if they desire alcohol, can either go to Egypt or Jordan.”</p>

      <p>The planned city, though, won’t compete with Dubai, but rather complement it and other parts of the Gulf,
        according to Prince Mohammed. It will create “new demand, not the same demand of Dubai,” he said. “It will help
        Dubai, it will help Bahrain. It will help especially Kuwait,” which can export to Europe faster and cheaper than
        now, he said.</p>
