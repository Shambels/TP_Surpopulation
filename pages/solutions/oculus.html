      <div>
        <p class="centrer">The Oculus is a vertical community. It is a place to live, work, and commune with nature. The building
          exemplifies a new urban high-rise typology where one can experience the human condition as it is meant to be,
          full of life.</p>
        <p class="centrer">The purpose of this skyscraper is to cultivate a sense of community through its mixed-use program (public,
          private, collective, and civic), and to promote a self-sustained environment through the building’s digital
          weather system and form.</p>
        <p class="centrer">The Oculus’ site was chosen in Lower Manhattan– at the intersection of Water Street, Pearl, and Beekman–
          wedged between corporate downtown and the industrial South Street Seaport.</p>
        <p class="centrer">The challenge of building on a “no air rights zone” ultimately lead the project to embrace its existing
          irregular shape, a triangular parcel that is surrounded by two intersections and a pedestrian walk-way.</p>

      <div class="flex tablet-wrap">
          <div class="case-tiers">

            </div>
        <div class="vertical-center">
          <p>The building’s concept was derived from its triangular footprint, and as a result, the unique form of the building evoked a new spiritual identity for the metropolitan community.</p>

            <p>The Oculus is a flexible and adaptable apparatus, which collects, develops, and sustains natural resources for the benefit of its inhabitants and surrounding society.</p>
            
            <p>The Oculus is a new approach to building technology based on its form and concept. It is a new deploy-able way of creating vertical topology anywhere. It is a solution to problems related to impending global change and human sprawl.</p>
            
            <p>By addressing the need for reusable water and the need for clean air in a city overrun with pollution, in addition to protecting the depletion of natural resources for the community, the design of The Oculus aims to resolve 21st century cultural and development issues.</p>
            
            <p>The Oculus embraces our most progressive environmental control strategies, all the while sustaining life within its one-of-a-kind form and infrastructure.</p>
